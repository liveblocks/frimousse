A lightweight, unstyled, and composable emoji picker for React.

- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Lightweight and fast**: Dependency-free, tree-shakable, and virtualized with minimal re-renders
- üé® **Unstyled and composable**: Bring your own styles and compose parts as you want
- üîÑ **Always up-to-date**: Latest emoji data is fetched when needed and cached locally
- üî£ **No ÔøΩ symbols**: Unsupported emojis are automatically hidden
- ‚ôøÔ∏è **Accessible**: Keyboard navigable and screen reader-friendly

## Installation

```bash
npm i frimousse
```

If you are using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), you can also install it as a pre-built component via the [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli).

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://frimousse.liveblocks.io/r/emoji-picker
```

Learn more in the [shadcn/ui](#shadcnui) section.

## Usage

Import the `EmojiPicker` parts and create your own component by composing them.

```tsx
import { EmojiPicker } from "frimousse";

export function MyEmojiPicker() {
  return (
    <EmojiPicker.Root>
      <EmojiPicker.Search />
      <EmojiPicker.Viewport>
        <EmojiPicker.Loading>Loading‚Ä¶</EmojiPicker.Loading>
        <EmojiPicker.Empty>No emoji found.</EmojiPicker.Empty>
        <EmojiPicker.List />
      </EmojiPicker.Viewport>
    </EmojiPicker.Root>
  );
}
```

Apart from a few sizing and overflow defaults, the parts don‚Äôt have any styles out-of-the-box. Being composable, you can bring your own styles and apply them however you want: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), CSS-in-JS, vanilla CSS via inline styles, classes, or by targeting the `[frimousse-*]` attributes present on each part.

You might want to use it in a popover rather than on its own. Frimousse only provides the emoji picker itself so if you don‚Äôt have a popover component in your app yet, there are several libraries available: [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/popover), [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/react/components/popover), [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/react/popover), and [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Popover.html), to name a few.

### shadcn/ui

If you are using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), you can install a pre-built version which integrates with the existing shadcn/ui variables via the [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli).

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://frimousse.liveblocks.io/r/emoji-picker
```

It can be composed and combined with other shadcn/ui components like [Popover](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/popover).

## Miscellaneous

The name [‚Äúfrimousse‚Äù](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/frimousse) means ‚Äúlittle face‚Äù in French, and it can also refer to smileys and emoticons.

The emoji picker component was originally created for the [Liveblocks Comments](https://liveblocks.io/comments) default components, within [`@liveblocks/react-ui`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/tree/main/packages/liveblocks-react-ui).

The emoji data is based on [Emojibase](https://emojibase.dev/).
